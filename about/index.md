# Brief Bio(til Feb. 2019)

Hi~ I am a undergraduate student(expected to graduate in 2019) at Harbin Institute of Technology([HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)). From June 2018 to (expected to 2019 July), I am doing my research internship at DiDi MapVision Group, and I am now supervised by Dr. Xu Pengfei. 

During last summer's work, I won the [COCO&Mapillary Detection Challenge, Instance Segmentation Track, ECCV 18](http://cocodataset.org/workshop/coco-mapillary-eccv-2018.html). Prior, I worked in [Massive Data Computing Research Center (MDC)](http://encs.hit.edu.cn/2016/0303/c5392a144385/page.htm) at HIT during 2017-2018 with a focus on sequential model and anomaly detection. Besides, I practiced my C++ programming skill by writing [data structures](https://github.com/Luodian/Data-Structure) and participating alogorithm contest.

I am now mainly working on instance segmentation task. I am focusing on improve detector's accurancy for tiny size object and use new methods to better localize objects' coordinates in object detection.

My vision for future research is to narrow the gap between human vision and machine vision. I hope my research can help car's and robot's vision system to better perceive the world.
