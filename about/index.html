<p>Hi~ I am a undergraduate student(expected to graduate in 2019) at Harbin Institute of Technology(<a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIT</a>). From June 2018 to (expected to 2019 July), I am doing my research internship at DiDi MapVision Group, and I am now supervised by Dr. Xu Pengfei. </p>
<p>During last summer’s work, I won the <a href="http://cocodataset.org/workshop/coco-mapillary-eccv-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COCO&amp;Mapillary Detection Challenge, Instance Segmentation Track, ECCV 18</a>. Prior, I worked in <a href="http://encs.hit.edu.cn/2016/0303/c5392a144385/page.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massive Data Computing Research Center (MDC)</a> at HIT during 2017-2018 with a focus on sequential model and anomaly detection. Besides, I practiced my C++ programming skill by writing <a href="https://github.com/Luodian/Data-Structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data structures</a> and participating alogorithm contest.</p>
<p>I am now mainly working on instance segmentation task. I am focusing on improve detector’s accurancy for tiny size object and use new methods to better localize objects’ coordinates in object detection.</p>
<p>I am now learning self-driving coursers via Cousera. My vision for future research is to narrow the gap between human vision and machine vision. I hope my research can help car’s and robot’s vision system to better perceive the world.</p>
